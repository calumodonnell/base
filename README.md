# Base Theme Framework
Website: [http://calumodonnell.co.uk](http://calumodonnell.co.uk)


## About
I developed this theme as a way to increase my knowledge on WordPress and to create a starter theme to use on new projects.
Based on the Underscores theme created by Automatic I have developed, 'base', a theme combining Underscores with Bootstrap 4.
This theme is available to use as a starter theme.


## Basic Features
- Combines Underscore's PHP files and BootstrapÂ´s HTML/CSS/JS
- Uses a single and minified CSS file
- A Sass hierarchy available
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) (V 4.6.0)
- Simple RTL file
- Jetpack ready
