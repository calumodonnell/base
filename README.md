## Base Theme Framework
Website: [http://calumodonnell.co.uk](http://calumodonnell.co.uk)


# About
I used the development of this theme as a way to increase my knowledge on WordPress theme creation and to develop a base theme to use on new projects.
Based on the Underscores theme, created by Automatic, I have developed, 'base', a theme combining the Underscores with Bootstrap and Sass.
This theme is available for use as a starter theme. I use 'base' as the parent theme and then I create my own child theme.


# Basic Features
- Combines Underscore's PHP files and BootstrapÂ´s HTML/CSS/JS
- Uses a single and minified CSS file
- A Sass hierarchy available
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) (V 4.6.0)
- Simple RTL file
- Jetpack ready
